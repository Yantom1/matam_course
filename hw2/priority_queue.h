/**
* Generic Priority Queue Container
*
* Implements a priority queue container type.
* The priority queue has an internal iterator for external use. For all functions
* where the state of the iterator after calling that function is not stated,
* it is undefined. That is you cannot assume anything about it.
*
* The following functions are available:
*   pqCreate		    - Creates a new empty priority queue
*   pqDestroy		    - Deletes an existing priority queue and frees all resources
*   pqCopy		        - Copies an existing priority queue
*   pqGetSize		    - Returns the size of a given priority queue
*   pqContains	        - returns weather or not an element exists inside the priority queue.
*   pqInsert	        - Insert an element with a given priority to the queue.
*   				        Duplication in the priority queue is allowed.
*   				        This resets the internal iterator.
*   pqChangePriority  	- Changes priority of an element with specific priority
*					        This resets the internal iterator.
*   pqRemove		    - Removes the highest priority element in the queue
*                           This resets the internal iterator.
*   pqGetFirst	        - Sets the internal iterator to the first element in the priority queue and returns it
*   pqGetNext		    - Advances the internal iterator to the next key and returns it.
*	pqClear		        - Clears the contents of the priority queue. Frees all the elements of
*	 				        the queue using the free function.
* 	PQ_FOREACH	        - A macro for iterating over the priority queue's elements.
